**v0.1**

Key functions have been developed such as:

- The user can `enter` the data `manually` or let the system `randomly` select the required input ;

- The user can `select` to calculate the final mark using either `the mean` or `median` .

**v0.1.1**

Updates from previous version:

- `Dynamism applied` in *v0.1 with arrays* when entering students (it is no longer necessary to specify the initial number of students to be entered) ;

- Standard `sort()` function and `? :` operator `applied` when calculating the median ;

- `Improved randomization` function to generate appropriately distributed grades .
